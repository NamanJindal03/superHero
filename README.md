It is a basic application which helps to search hereos and add them to yor favourite list
The whole code is done using vanilla js 
I solved the problem of CORS using an extension of CORS on chrome, to run the application that needs to be done.
There are three webpages in this
    1) index.html
    2) favourite-hereos.html (To see your fav hereos list)
    3) individual-hereos.html (To view detailed info about the hero)
